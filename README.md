# SRegister 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dsantosp12/SRegister.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dsantosp12/SRegister)

SRegister is a tool that helps facilities deal with the problem of signing students and visitors into dorm buildings.
The idea is to stop using the clasic paper form, and instead use a database to store and manage work. This application
makes sure that the host cannot signing more than 2 people, and more functionalities that will be described later.
